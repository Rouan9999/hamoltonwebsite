              <p>Alexander Hamilton was born on the island of St. Croix to James Hamilton 
                and Rachel Fawcett Lavine. His father left the family when Alexander was young,
                 leaving Rachel to support him and his brother. Alexander started working in a 
                 countinghouse at the age of 11, and when Rachel died in 1768, he became a ward of 
                 his motherâ€™s relatives. He was a hard worker and was eventually promoted to manager
                  at the countinghouse. Later, he went to school in New Jersey and then to King's College 
                  in New York. He was a successful student, but his studies were interrupted by the growing
                   rebellion against Great Britain. Hamilton supported the Boston Tea Party and wrote three 
                   influential pamphlets in 1774-75 that supported the Continental Congress agreements and 
                   criticized British policy. These pamphlets were important and showed Hamilton's talent,
                    and some were even attributed to other famous American writers. </p>

                Alexander Hamilton was a key figure in America's early history. 
                In the 1780s, he worked to improve the country's financial and political systems, arguing for
                 a strong central government. He also practiced law and defended loyalists who remained loyal
                  to Britain during the Revolutionary War. Hamilton won a seat in the New York legislature and
                   was appointed to the Annapolis convention, where he helped draft the address that led to the
                    Constitutional Convention. Although he favored a powerful federal government, he did not take
                     an active role in the convention's debates. He did, however, present his own plan for a national 
                     government, which gave the federal government unlimited power over the states. The convention 
                     ultimately framed a constitution that balanced strong federal power with the likelihood of
                      being accepted by the people. Hamilton signed the Constitution, despite knowing that his state
                       wished only to revise the Articles of Confederation. To defend the Constitution against opposition,
                        Hamilton wrote under the pseudonyms "Caesar" and "Publius." With James Madison and John Jay,
                         he wrote The Federalist, a collection of 85 essays that explained and defended the Constitution.
                          The essays had a significant impact on American political thought and institutions. At the
                           ratifying convention, Hamilton was a key advocate for the Constitution and successfully won
                            approval for it.

                On July 11, 1804, Alexander Hamilton fought a duel with Aaron Burr, the Vice President 
                of the United States, in Weehawken, New Jersey. The rivalry between the two men had been 
                brewing for years, but the duel was sparked by Hamilton's alleged disparaging comments
                about Burr. The duel resulted in Hamilton being mortally wounded and he died the following 
                day. Burr was charged with murder, but the charges were eventually dropped. The incident was 
                a tragic reminder of the dangers of political rivalry and the deadly consequences that can
                 result from it.
